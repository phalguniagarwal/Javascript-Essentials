Assignment 2:

Question 1:
<script>
     const clothes=['jacket','t-shirt'];
     clothes.length=0;
      console.log(clothes[1]);
</script>
           
Output: Undefined
Reason: The length of the array "clothes" is defined zero. 
If we change the length of the array to 1, and write console.log(clothes[0]), it will show jacket.
if we change the length of the array to 1 but show output clothes[1], it will give output undefined as the length is defined as 1.
if we change the length of array to 2, then console.log(clothes[0]] will show jacket and console.log(clothes[1]) will show t-shirt. 

Question 2:


<script>
  var array = [16,27,38,40]
  var sum = 0;
  for(var i = 0; i < array.length; i++)
  {
  sum += array[i]
  }
console.log('Your sum is ' + sum);
</script>
